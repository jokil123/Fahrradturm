\section*{\centering{Abstract}}
In recent years, cycling has become an increasingly popular and environmentally friendly alternative to cars. E-bikes in particular have gained popularity in the latest years, as they offer a fast and efficient way to get around. However, theft and vandalism of expensive bikes are a major problem and there is a shortage of secure parking and charging options for bikes.

\smallskip \noindent Our goal is to design an automated bicycle tower, which is a vertical storage system designed to securely store bicycles in a limited space. By developing this technology, e-bikes can be made more attractive. The goal is to encourage more people to use a bicycle and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

\smallskip \noindent The project idea came from our project supervisor Günter Hämmerle, who put us in contact with our partner company LTW Intralogistics. The topic sparked our interest immediately and we quickly decided to work out the task as our diploma thesis. With the thesis we had both a challenging job and a broad subject area.

\smallskip \noindent This thesis shows a market analysis, the design of two new automated bicycle towers and the development of a prototype, to show how an automated bicycle tower works.
